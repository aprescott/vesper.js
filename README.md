# Vesper

Vesper.js is a tiny library to detect same-origin redirects.

In English, if /your/page contains a link to /foo, and /foo redirects to /bar,
you could  detect the /foo -> /bar redirect and do something, such as
passively record /your/page as requiring old URLs to be updated.

# Usage

    <script src="vesper.js"></script>
    <script>
        Vesper.configure({
            onRedirected: function(redirectSource, redirectTarget, originatingPage) {
                console.log("redirect from " + redirectSource + " to " + redirectTarget);
                console.log("redirect found on " + originatingPage);
            }
        });
    </script>

Vesper has no dependencies, but does rely on two features from HTML5:

    * Navigation Timing, specifically window.performance.navigation
    * Web Storage, specifically sessionStorage

Due to browser restrictions, redirects can only be detected if both
source and target satisfy the same-origin policy.
